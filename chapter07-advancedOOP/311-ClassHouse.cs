/*
Ex.311: Class House

Create a class "House", with an attribute "area", a constructor that sets its 
value and a method "ShowData" to display "I am a house, my area is 200 m2" 
(instead of 200, it will show the real surface). Include getters an setters for 
the area, too.

The "House" will contain a door. Each door will have an attribute "color" (a 
string), and a method "ShowData" which will display "I am a door, my color is 
brown" (or whatever color it really is). Include a getter and a setter. Also, 
create a "GetDoor" in the house.

A "SmallApartment" is a subclass of House, with a preset area of 50 m2.

Also create a class Person, with a name (string). Each person will have a 
house. The method "ShowData" for a person will display his/her name, show the 
data of his/her house and the data of the door of that house.

Write a Main to create a SmallApartment, a person to live in it, and to show 
the data of the person.
