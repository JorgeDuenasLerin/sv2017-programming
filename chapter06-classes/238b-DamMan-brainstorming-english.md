* The user moves a character (Pac-man)

* There are 4 ghosts which move on their own.

* The character and the ghosts move through corridors delimited by walls and containing "dots" and big "power pellets".

* Each ghost has a partially different movement.

* Ghosts start from a "house" in the center of the screen.

* The character eats "dots" that are distributed on the game screen.

* The character can eat "power pellets", which allow him to eat ghosts for a while; at the end of that time, the ghosts start chasing the player again; during that time, they change their color (to blue), try to escape from the character, move slower and return to the center if they die (if the character "eats them").

* The character has 3 lives and loses one each time he collides with a ghost (except if he has just eaten a "power pellet").

* Sometimes fruits that can be eaten and extra score is obtained.

* If you get the 6 fruits you get an extra life?

* When the player eats all the balls, they advance to the next level (in which all the "dots" are visible again).

* The character moves automatically until it hits a wall.

* There is a welcome screen that shows the ghosts, their name and color.

* If the player waits in the welcome screen, a Demo is launched.

* The current score is displayed and the maximum score is saved.

* There is a two-player mode, with alternate turns.
